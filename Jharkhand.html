According to writers including Gautam Kumar Bera,there was already a distinct geo-political, cultural entity called Jharkhand even before the Magadha Empire. During the age of Mahajanpadas around 500 BC, Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha and Anga[citation needed]. Jharkhand was part of greater Magadha region and was in some way culturally different from Historical Vedic religion.

Samudragupta, while marching through the present-day Chotanagpur region, directed the first attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley.<br>

The Mughal influence reached Palamu during the reign of Emperor Akbar when it was invaded by Raja Mansingh in 1574. In 1629, Emperor Shah Jahan appointed Ahmad Khan as the sufedar of Patna. Palamu was conferred to him as Jagir. Ahmad Khan imposed tax of Rs.1,36,000. The non-payment of this mandatory tax by Chero rulers of Palamu led to three successive attacks by the Mughals. The first invasion took place in the reign of Pratap Rai. The Mughal army was led by Shaista Khan the Governor of Bihar. The army reached the fort of Palamu, defeated Pratap Rai and compelled to pay tax of Rs.80,000. After second invasion, Pratap Rai agreed to pay an annual tax off Rs. One lakh. On the recommendation of Itaikad Khan, successor of Shaista Khan, Emperor Shahjehan gave Palamu to him as a military chief on a jama of Rs.2.5 laksh. At last, Daud Khan, who launched his invasion starting from Patna on 3 April 1660, attacked south of Gaya district and finally arrived at the Palamu Forts on 9 December 1660. The terms of surrender and payment of tribute were not acceptable to the Cheros; Daud Khan wanted complete conversion of all Hindus under the Chero rule to Islam. Following this, Khan mounted a series of attacks on the forts. Cheros defended the forts but ultimately both forts were occupied.<br>

The King Medini Ray (1662–1674), ruled for thirteen years from 1662 to 1674 in Palamau.His rule extended to areas in South Gaya and Hazaribagh. He attacked Navratangarh and defeated the Maharaja of Chhotanagpur.<br>

Following the death of Medini Ray there was rivalry within the royal family of the Chero dynasty which ultimately lead to its downfall; this was engineered by the ministers and advisers in the court.In 1765, the region came under the control of the British East India Company. Chitrajeet Rai's nephew Gopal Rai betrayed him and facilitated the Patna Council of the British East India Company to attack the fort. When the new fort was attacked by Captain Camac on 28 January 1771, the Chero soldiers fought valiantly but had to retreat to the old fort on account of water shortage. This facilitated the British army to occupy the new fort located on a hill without any struggle. This location was strategic and enabled the British to mount canon supply and the old fort was besieged by the British on 19 March 1771.The fort was finally occupied by the British in 1772. Region under Kings of Chero dynasty, Nagvansh and Ramgarh became parts of territories of East India Company.

The subjugation and colonisation of Jharkhand region by the British East India Company resulted in spontaneous resistance from the local people.

The first ever revolt against the landlords and the British government was led by Tilka Manjhi, a Paharia leader in Rajmahal Hills in 1771.Soon after in 1779, the Bhumij tribes rose in arms against the British rule in Manbhum.

In 1807, the Oraons in Barway murdered their big landlord from Srinagar. Munda tribe rose in revolt in 1811 and 1813.

Bakhtar Sai and Mundal Singh, two landowners, fought against the British East India company in 1812. When the British ordered Govind Nath Shahdeo, the king of Chotanagpur, to pay Rs.12,000 as tax to the East India Company, Bakthar Say refused on the behalf of peasants. It provoked a fight in which Bakhtar Sai killed Hira Ram, the Ratu courtier which was sent to collect the tax. The magistrate of Ramgarh then sent an army from Hazaribagh under Lieutenant H. Odonel. At this time, Mundal Singh reached Navagarh to help Bakhtar Sai. Sai's army made up of farmers of the area. Later, E. Rafreez of Ramgarh Battalion planned a second charge with a large army. Sai and Singh were forced to seek shelter with Jashpur ruler Ranjeet Singh. The latter betrayed them and they were arrested and taken to Calcutta where they were executed on 4 April, 1812. 

The Princly states in Chota Nagpur Plateau, came within the sphere of influence of the Maratha Empire, but they became tributary states of British East India Company as a result of the Anglo-Maratha Wars known as Chota Nagpur Tributary States.

The Hos in Singhbhum revolted in 1820, Kol revolt in 1832 West Bengal.


Santhal rebellion against Zamindari system during British Company Raj in 1855
The Santhal rebellion broke out in 1855 under the leadership of two brothers Sidhu and Kanhu.

The brothers Nilambar and Pitambar were chiefs of Bhogta clan of the Kharwar tribe, who held ancestral jagirs. Immediately after they heard movement against the British rule they made up their minds to declare independence. They were joined by many Chero Jagirdars. On 21st October, 1857 a force of 500 persons was organised which was led by Nilambar and Pitamber. They attacked Raghubar Dayal at Chainpur since he had sided with the British. From there they proceeded to Lesliganj. Lt. Graham was besieged in the house of Raghubar Dayal. In December, two companies arrived under Major Cotter. He was able to capture Devi Baksh Rai, one of the principal leaders of the movement. In January Col. Dalton, the Commissioner came to Palamu and captured the Palamu Fort. Ultimately the insurgents were captured and peace was restored soon afterwards.

Thakur Vishwanath Sahdeo, local chief rebelled against Brithish East India Company in 1857 rebellion. He was fighting with Britishers, but caught due to treachery and was hanged in April 16, 1858.<br>
